Based on the plots above,we can conclude that as the literacy rate in women increases, the fertility rate decreases sharply in densely populated countries of Asia and Africa.

# Analysis 2

Analysis 2 : Analysis on unemployment rate in countries
- Found Countries with least and most unemployment rate
- Analysed the unemployment based on various factors in the country with least and most unemployment rate.
- Seaborn plot used for displaying the results
- Performed data cleaning and formatted as per requirement for analysis. CSV file included


Based on the analysis, we find that Kuwait has the least unmployment rate and Macedonia has the maximum unemployment rate.Below we perform Unemployment rate analysis on Kuwait and Macedonia based on 2 factors : education and gender

# Analysis 4

Analysis 4 : A comparative analysis on population and mortality across income level between 1993 and 2013.

- Get data for countries based on their income types
- Get data based on indicators for population and mortality.
- Plot data using Seaborn factorplot

<img src="https://github.com/vegashetty/Python-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Final%20exam%20Analysis/analysis/ana_4/ana_4.1.png">

Based on the first analysis we can conclude that "Lower middle income countries" have a much higher population density as compared to other income levels

<img src="https://github.com/vegashetty/Python-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Final%20exam%20Analysis/analysis/ana_4/ana_4.2.png">

Based on the second analysis we can conclude that "Low income countries" have maximum deaths due to communicable diseases as compared to other income levels and "High income countries" have maximum deaths due to non-communicable diseases as compared to other income levels.
