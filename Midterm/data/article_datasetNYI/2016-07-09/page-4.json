He was surrounded by his family. Dr. Zervoudakis was an Associate Attending Obstetrician and Gynecologist at New York-Presbyterian Hospital and an Associate Professor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Zervoudakis practiced and taught at Weill Cornell since 1971, except for the period of 1979-1991 in which he returned to Athens, Greece, to teach and practice at the Alexandra Hospital and LITO Maternity Hospital. Dr. Zervoudakis earned his Medical Degree from the University of Athens in 1963 and his Ph.D. from the National University of Athens Faculty of Medicine. After obtaining his degrees, he completed his military service as a doctor in the Greek Navy. His post- doctoral training included an internship at Coney Island Hospital, a residency and the position of Chief Resident at The New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center, and a Fellowship in Maternal and Fetal Medicine at Cornell University Medical College. He was born on June 17, 1943, in Greece to his parents, Dr. Andreas Zervoudakis, also an obstetrician and gynecologist, and Aliki Zervoudakis (born Papaleonardou). He devoted his life to his family and the practice of medicine and estimated that he delivered over 20,000 babies during his career. Dr. Zervoudakis specialized in high-risk obstetrics and his research lead to the development of new techniques in treating uterine fibroids. He was a pioneer of the \"fetus as patient\" concept. He was a two-time Lalor Foundation Fellow and grant recipient from the National Institute of Health. Dr. Zervoudakis adored classical music and was a gourmet chef. He was a true gourmand and an extraordinarily generous and kind man. He enjoyed spending time with this wife, his children and his grandchildren. In his youth he was a well-respected scout leader of the Scouts of Greece or Soma Hellinon Proskopon. Dr. Zervoudakis was a member of the Hellenic Medical Society of New York, and served on the Board of Trustees of the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. Dr. Zervoudakis is survived by his wife of nearly 46 years Rallou, his daughters Alice, Christina and Laura, sons-in- law Jim and Adam, grandchildren Natalie, John (his namesake), Alexander and Andreas, all of Manhattan, his sister Sophia Gouras and his nephews Andreas and Konstantinos Gouras, of Athens, Greece.

He was a longtime supporter of the IRC, an organization founded in 1933 to aid victims of the Nazis, joining the IRC Board in 1985 and the IRC Overseers in 2004. Before joining the IRC Board, Mr. Wiesel was a member of the IRC's Citizens Commission on Indochinese Refugees--a group whose advocacy work helped lead to the passing of the U.S. Refugee Act of 1980. In 1980, Commission members visited a Cambodian refugee camp, where Mr. Wiesel explained, \"I came here because nobody came when I was there. One thing that is worse for the victim than hunger, fear, torture, is the feeling of abandonment, the feeling that nobody cares, the feeling that you don't count.\" In 1987, the IRC honored Mr. Wiesel with the Freedom Award, presented by Liv Ullmann, for his \"extraordinary service to humanity, freedom and the cause of refugees.\" We extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family.
