The former long-term resident of Belle Terre, NY, and Tequesta, FL, was born in Brooklyn, NY on September 29, 1927, the only child of Joseph A. and Dorothea Rice. She attended the College of New Rochelle where she studied to be a speech therapist. She married her best friend's cousin - Neill Alexander McAllister, a lifetime executive with McAllister Bros, a family-owned marine towing and transportation company founded in 1864; he predeceased her in 1991. Barbara and Neill were the proud parents of eight children: Mary Fader (Samuel), of Dover, MA; Alexandra Woodfield (Gary), of Palm Beach, FL; Suzanne, of Glenside, PA; Neill (Mary Ghegan), of New York, NY; Patrick, of Hamden, CT; Elizabeth Pope (Paul) of Jenkintown, PA; Dennis (Sarah Aderholt) of New Canaan, CT and Nancy (Richard Card), of New York, NY; nine grandchildren, and seven great- grandchildren. Barbara was fortunate to meet, laugh with, and marry Stanley (Bud) Doggett in 1998; he died in 2002. Those who knew, or heard of her, proclaimed she was the \"most beautiful girl in Brooklyn.\" She maintained that beauty and elegance until the end. She was strong-minded, smart, a critical thinker, and had a way with words. Her proudest achievements were her children. She was happiest when surrounded by them and their families at reunions in Belle Terre. She was unforgettable. Her family is grieving. A wake for Barbara will be held at O.B. Davis Funeral Home in Port Jefferson Station, NY, on Tuesday, July 19 from 5pm- 8pm. Funeral Mass will be held at Infant Jesus Chapel at St Charles Hospital, in Port Jefferson, NY, at 10:30am on Wednesday, July 20. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in her honor to Hope House Ministries, PO Box 358, Port Jefferson, NY 11777.<br><br>\n ",
