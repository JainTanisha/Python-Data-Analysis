        "lead_paragraph": "<!-- SHIRLEY KOBLINER -->KOBLINER--Shirley<br/><br/> (nee Cohen), passed away on July 1, surrounded by her loving family: her husband of 65 years, Harold Kobliner, who was her best friend, confidant and soul mate; her son, Perry Kobliner; her son and daughter-in-law, Kenneth and Miriam Kobliner; and her daughter and son-in-law, Beth Kobliner Shaw and David Shaw. Shirley was a spectacular wife, mother and grandmother, who cherished, more than would seem humanly possible, her husband, children, children-in-law and six grandchildren, Rebecca, Adam, Benjamin, Joshua, Sarah and Jacob. Shirley and Harold's marriage was a miraculous one in their unwavering support and admiration for each other. Theirs was a true love. He was her number one, and she was his. Anyone who ever crossed paths with them knows how extraordinary their beautiful union was. Shirley adored being a wife, mother and grandmother, and relished that experience with genuine joy, humor and zest. She was good, honest and kind, and encouraged her children always. Born in 1929 in Astoria, Queens, Shirley treasured childhood days spent with her mother Belle, father Ben, sister Betty, and brother Murray, who died at age 10. It was a time when resources were scarce, but love was abundant. Shirley would often recall fondly how much she loved helping her father weigh and measure the medications he dispensed at his business, Cohen's Pharmacy, and it was there that her love of chemistry took root. Shirley graduated with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry from Queens College in 1951. When she was 16 years old, at the encouragement of her mother, she attended a dance at the 92nd Street Y, where she met Harold Kobliner, then 17, who was from the Bronx. It turned out to be well worth the three subway trains and a bus that Harold had had to take to get there, since he won Shirley over, and they were married in 1951. Shirley taught chemistry in the New York City public high schools, and she was a wonderful support to Harold as he went on to get his Ph.D. in education. \"I could never have done it without her,\" he would say to everyone they met, adding that she was his inspiration. After raising their three children in Bayside, Queens, Harold and Shirley moved to Great Neck, Long Island. As a member of Temple Israel, Shirley embarked on a series of roles in the Temple Israel Players' productions such as Oklahoma!, Fiddler on the Roof and Guys & Dolls, in which she played a Hot Box girl. Shirley also volunteered countless hours for the Association for Neurologically Impaired Brain Injured Children (ANIBIC) in Queens, where she was honored for her hard work and dedication. Funeral services will take place at 11am on Sunday, July 3, at Riverside-Nassau North Chapel, 55 North Station Plaza, Great Neck, New York. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research by mail at P.O. Box 5014, Hagerstown, MD, 21741-5014 or online at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"www.michaeljfox.org\">www.michaeljfox.org</a><br><br>\n ",

        "lead_paragraph": "<!-- MAURICE LAMM -->LAMM--Maurice, Rabbi<br/><br/> The Yeshiva University family and the affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) are profoundly saddened by the passing of one of our institution's most illustrious alumni, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Z\"l, who graduated from Yeshiva College (1951), RIETS (1954) and The Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies (1973). He received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from our institution where he served as the Professor of Professional Rabbinics in the Chair established by members of Beth Jacob Congregation of Beverly Hills, where he served from 1972 to 1985 as spiritual leader before retiring from the congregation. He then established the Palm Springs Desert Synagogue and served as its rabbi for several years. Earlier, after graduating from RIETS, he started as a Chaplain in the United States Armed Forces and following that began his career as a pulpit rabbi in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Earlier, while in New York, he served as Rabbi of the Floral Park Synagogue and the Hebrew institute of University Heights in the Bronx. While there, he helped the other rabbis in the Bronx/Riverdale area and their lay leaders to establish the SAR Academy. His rabbinic career was capped by his founding and serving as the President of the National Institute of Jewish Hospice in 1985, in which his beloved wife, Shirley Lamm, assisted him. He was world renowned as the author of some five significant books; the first and most famous is The Jewish Way in Death and Mourning, of which 275,000 copies were sold, helping many more thousands of families cope with their bereavement. His other books are The Jewish Way in Love and Marriage, Becoming a Jew, The Power of Hope and Consolation. His kindness, warmth, wisdom and genuine concern for strengthening Jewish life was shared with young rabbinic colleagues in the field, whom he visited as a consultant under the Jack E. and Rachel Gindi Rabbinic Mentoring Program at RIETS. He was the proud younger brother of Rabbi Dr. Norman Lamm, President Emeritus of Yeshiva University, who served for 27 years as President, and of their cherished sisters, Tzibby Citner and Miriam Auslander. He was devoted to his beloved wife, Shirley Lamm, his Ayshet Chayil, a veritable \"Woman of Valor,\" who helped him survive serious illness for many years. He was the revered father of his loving children, David Lamm, Judith Young, of blessed memory, and Dodi Lee Lamm, and the doting grandfather of 18 grandchildren and 35 great- grandchildren, all of whom carry on his legacy of love and concern for their Torah heritage, which he inspired. Heartfelt condolences are extended to Shirley Lamm, their wonderful children and all their progeny and their former congregants whose lives were touched by this unique leader of the Jewish people. May they be comforted among all who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, President Emeritus<br><br>\n ",
